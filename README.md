## Overview
This is the website I created for my game development company, Moosepark Studios.

It first gives a brief overview of the our team's mission statement.
It describes the vision we had for our debut game, [Rainbow Drift](https://github.com/stanleyjia/RainbowDrift), and chronicles the 2+ year long journey it took to take the game from idea to final product.
