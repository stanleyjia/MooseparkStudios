## Overview
This is the website I created for my game development company, Moosepark Studios.

It first gives a brief overview of the our team's mission statement.
It describes the vision we had for our debut game, Rainbow Drift, and chronicles the 2+ year long journey it took to take the game from idea to final product.

## Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
