        <h5>IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS
            DETAILED IN SECTION 13 BELOW
        </h5>
        </br><br>
        <p>
            Please read these Terms of Use (collectively with the Moosepark Studios Privacy Policy, the "Terms of Use")
            fully and carefully before using the Rainbow Drift application (the “App”) and the services, features,
            content or applications offered by Moosepark Studios, Inc. in connection with the App (“Company,” “we”,
            “us” or “our”) (together with the App, the “Services”). These Terms of Use set forth the legally binding
            terms and conditions for your use of the App and the Services.

            </br><br>
            <b>Acceptance of Terms of Use</b>
            </br><br>
            By signing up for, installing and/or using the App in any manner, you agree to these Terms of Use and all
            other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time through the App by
            us, each of which is incorporated by reference and each of which may be updated from time to time without
            notice to you.
            <br></br>
            Certain of the Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions specified by us from time to
            time; your use of such Services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated
            into these Terms of Use by this reference.
            <br></br>
            These Terms of Use apply to all users of the Services, including, without limitation, users who are
            contributors of content, information, and other materials or services, registered or otherwise.
            <br></br>
            ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE
            ARBITRATION SECTION BELOW (SECTION 13), YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY
            BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR
            CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.
            <br></br>
            <b>Eligibility</b>
            <br></br>
            You represent and warrant that you are an individual person at least 18 years of age. If you
            are under age 18, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. We may, in our
            sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria
            at any time. You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms of Use are in compliance with all
            laws, rules and regulations applicable to you and the right to access the Services is revoked where these
            Terms of Use or use of the Services is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale or provision of the
            Services conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation. Further, the Services are offered only for
            your use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party. You are not eligible for our Contests if you
            violate any provision of these Terms of Use or the Rainbow Drift Contest Official Rules, as determined in
            Moosepark Studio’s sole discretion.
            <br></br>
            <b>Registration</b>
            <br></br>
            To sign up for the Services, we may require you to register for an Account on the Services
            (an "Account") or log in via Facebook Connect, Twitter or another authentication mechanism (a “Third Party
            Account”). You must provide accurate and complete information and keep your Account information updated. If
            you provide any information that is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Company has reasonable
            grounds to suspect that such information is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Company may deny you
            access to Contests, areas requiring registration, disqualify you from Contests, revoke Prizes, and/or
            terminate your Account, at its sole discretion.

            <br></br>
            You shall not: (i) select or use as a username a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that
            person; (ii) use as a username a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate
            authorization; or (iii) use, as a username, a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. You are
            solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and for keeping your Account password and
            login credentials secure. You may never use another person’s user Account or registration information for
            the Services without permission. You must notify us immediately of any change in your eligibility to use
            the Services (including any changes to or revocation of any licenses from state authorities), breach of
            security or unauthorized use of your Account. You should never publish, distribute or post login
            information for your Account. You shall have the ability to delete your Account, either directly or through
            a request made to one of our employees or affiliates.

            <br></br>
            You may establish, maintain, use and control only one Account on the Service. Each Account on the Service
            may only be owned, maintained, used and controlled by one individual. For avoidance of doubt, users may not
            "co-own" accounts on the Service. In the event Company determines that you have opened, maintained, used or
            controlled more than one Account, in addition to any other rights that Company may have, Company reserves
            the right to suspend or terminate any or all of your accounts and terminate, withhold or revoke the
            awarding of any Prizes.
            <br></br>
            Each year all winners over the previous year may be required to provide updated address and social security
            (or other tax identification number) details to Company. These details will be used to allow Company to
            comply with tax regulations and may be shared with appropriate tax authorities. You, not Company, are
            responsible for filing and paying applicable state and federal taxes on any winnings. Company does not
            provide tax advice, nor should any statements in this Agreement or on the Service be construed as tax
            advice.
            <br></br>
            <h4><b>Content</b></h4>
            <br></br>

            <br></br>
            For purposes of these Terms of Use, the term "Content" includes, without limitation, information, data,

            of the person who originated such User Content. You represent that all User Content provided by you is
            accurate, complete, up-to-date, and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. You
            retain ownership of any and all User Content created and/or uploaded by you. You acknowledge that all
            Content, including User Content, accessed by you using the Services is at your own risk and you will be
            solely responsible for any damage or loss to you or any other party resulting therefrom. We do not
            guarantee that any Content you access on or through the Services is or will continue to be accurate.
            <br></br>
            <b>Notices and Restrictions</b>

            Subject to these Terms of Use, we grant each user of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive,
            non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use (i.e., to download and display locally) Content
            solely for purposes of using the Services. Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any
            Content (other than your User Content) for other than purposes of using the Services is expressly
            prohibited without prior written permission from us. You shall not sell, license, rent, or otherwise use or
            exploit any Content (other than your User Content) for commercial use or in any way that violates any third
            party right.


            <br></br>
            <b>License Grant</b>

            <br></br>
            By submitting User Content through the Services, you hereby do and shall grant us a worldwide,
            non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, edit,
            modify, manipulate, truncate, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display,
            perform, and otherwise fully exploit the User Content in connection with the App, the Services and our (and
            our successors’ and assigns’) businesses, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing
            part or all of the App or the Services (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any
            media channels (including, without limitation, third party websites and feeds), and including after your
            termination of your Account or the Services. For the sake of clarity, to the extent any User Content you
            submit includes your name, likeness, voice, video, or photograph, you acknowledge and agree that the
            foregoing license of this Section 4(e) shall apply to the same. You also hereby do and shall grant each
            user of the App and/or the Services a non-exclusive, perpetual license to access your User Content through
            the App and/or the Services, and to use, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of,
            display and perform such User Content, including after your termination of your Account or the Services.
            For clarity, the foregoing license granted to us and our users does not affect your other ownership or
            license rights in your User Content, including the right to grant additional licenses to your User Content,
            unless otherwise agreed in writing. You represent and warrant that you have all rights to grant such
            licenses to us without infringement or violation of any third party rights, including without limitation,
            any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, or any other intellectual
            property or proprietary rights.

            <b>Availability of Content</b>
            <br></br>
            We do not guarantee that any Content will be made available on the App or through the Services. We reserve
            the right to, but do not have any obligation to, (i) remove, edit or modify or otherwise manipulate any
            Content in our sole discretion, at any time, without notice to you and for any reason (including, but not
            limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such
            Content or if we are concerned that you may have violated these Terms of Use), or for no reason at all and
            (ii) to remove or block any Content from the Services.

            <b>ARBITRATION CLAUSE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER–IMPORTANT–PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</b>
            <br></br>
            <b>13.1. Binding Arbitration</b>
            <br></br>
            Either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set
            forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation,
            performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be
            finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its
            Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class
            actions.

            <br></br>
            The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to
            resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
            formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are
            void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant
            whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be
            written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
            jurisdiction.

            <br></br>
            The Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.jamsadr.com or by calling
            1.800.352.5267. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit,
            Company will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Company
            will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not
            exceed $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The
            parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and
            have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed
            the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

            <br></br>
            <b>13.2 Location</b>
            <br></br>
            If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within
            the United States convenient for you. For residents in Canada, arbitration shall be initiated in the County
            of New York, State of New York, United States of America, and you and Company agree to submit to the
            personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel
            arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on
            the award entered by the arbitrator.
            <br></br>
            <b>13.3 Class Action Waiver</b>
            <br></br>
            The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and
            not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a
            class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
            OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
            CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set
            forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a
            class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety
            and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

            <br></br>
            <b>13.4 Exception–Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</b>
            <br></br>
            Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring
            an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual property
            rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or
            publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within
            the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.

            <br></br>
            <b>13.5 30-Day Right to Opt Out</b>
            <br></br>
            You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set
            forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Moosepark
            Studios, Inc., 236 Kingfisher Ave, Alameda, California 10012. The notice must be sent within 30 days of
            04/20/2018 or your first use of the Service, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate
            disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions,
            Company also will not be bound by them.
            <br></br>
            <b> 13.6 Changes to this Section</b>
            <br></br>
            Company will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the
            60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.
            <br></br>
            For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Company agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
            jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in Alameda, CA. You further agree to
            accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise
            available.

            <br></br>
            The Terms and the relationship between you and Company shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
            York without regard to conflict of law provisions.

            <br></br>
            <b>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</b>
            <br></br>

            Both you and the Company acknowledge that these Terms of Use are concluded between you and the Company
            only, and not with Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for the Application or the Content;

            <br></br>
            The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable basis,

            You will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device that you own or control;

            You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support
            services with respect to the Application;
            <br></br>
            In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those
            implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s sole warranty obligation
            to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;

            <br></br>
            You acknowledge and agree that the Company, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or
            any third party may have in relation to the Application;
