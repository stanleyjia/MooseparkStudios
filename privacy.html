            This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Moosepark Studios, Inc. (“we”, “our” or “us”)
            on the collection, use and disclosure of your information in connection with your use of the Rainbow Drift
            application (the “App”) and any associated services, features, content or applications we offer through the
            App (collectively, the “Services”). We receive information about you from various sources, including
            without limitation: (i) if you register for the App and the Services, through your user account on the
            Services (your “Account”); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and
            services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage,
            disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </br><br>
            <b>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover</b>
            </br><br>
            This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”)
            gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any
            Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control,
            including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (e.g. Spotify, iTunes,
            YouTube, Google Play, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Game Center, etc.) (each a “Third Party Service”) that
            you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt
            to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot
            take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to
            carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.
            <br></br>
            <b>What Information Do We Collect?</b>
            </br><br>
            The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In
            connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your
            Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.
            <i>Account Information:</i>
            If you create an account on the Services (“Account”), you may be required to provide information that could
            be Personal Information, such as your name, phone number and/or email address. Additionally, if you
            register for or access the Services using a Third Party Service (such as your social media account login
            credentials), we may receive Personal Information that you allow such Third Party Service to share with us.
            You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account and providing
            Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be
            anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services. You may
            unsubscribe from some of these messages by emailing us at support@hy.pe, although we, regardless, reserve
            the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for account recovery purposes.
            Information Regarding Your Social Networks:
            As mentioned above, you may be able to register for or access the Services using a Third Party Services,
            such as your social media account (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.). Occasionally, you can also use
            your Account on our Services to interact with your accounts on these other services. For example, you may
            be able to access posting and sharing tools on the Services that allow you to post information to your
            social networks outside of the Services (“Share”). By using these tools, you acknowledge that some account
            information from your account on the applicable Third Party Service may be transmitted into your Account
            with us, and that such information is covered by this Privacy Policy. Furthermore, if a tool, such as the
            Share tool, is operated by a Third Party Service, the Third Party Service that operates the tool may
            collect information about your browser or online activity, which would be subject to the Third Party
            Service’s privacy policy. When you use these tools, some of your information from the Services may be
            shared with the Third Party Service and others. Therefore, we encourage you to read the privacy policies
            and other policies of any Third Party Services, including without limitation any applicable social
            networks, you use in connection with the Services.
            Additionally, we may collect and receive your social media account login credentials in connection with
            providing you with the Services, but only if you expressly provide us with such information. We will only
            use such login information as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise expressly authorized by you.
            <i>User Content:</i>
            Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as video clips. All
            content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your
            Account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal
            Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
            <i>Location Information:</i>
            Some of our Services may include features based on users’ actual locations and may report on users’ current
            locations (“Location-Based Services”). To the extent you voluntarily opt to use any Location-Based
            Services, we may collect and store information about your location at the time you use those Location-Based
            Services. Additionally, we may also collect and/or receive location information from your use of the
            Services generally, which can come from a variety of sources, depending on how you use or access the
            Services. For example, a User Image taken from your mobile device may contain location information related
            to where the image was taken, or a mobile device may report its GPS location at the time Location-Based
            Services are used.
            <i>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</i>
            Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of
            visitors to the App and users of the Services. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a
            statistical measure, or in other anonymous forms, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
            This type of data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use
            parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.
            We automatically receive and record information from your web browser and device when you interact with the
            Services, including your IP address and cookie information and other mobile identifiers. This information
            is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction
            with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).
            We may collect some device-specific information if you access the Services using a mobile device. Device
            information may include but is not limited to unique device identifiers, network information, and hardware
            model, as well as information about how the device interacts with our Services.
            <i>Email, Text, and Push Notification Communications:</i>
            We may communicate with you via push notification, email, SMS, MMS or other text message (“Message”) (to
            the extent you permit us to do so), and we may collect information regarding such communications, such as
            confirmation when you open an email, read a Message or receive a push notification. We use this information
            to improve our Services, including without limitation our customer service.
            <i>Aggregate Information[a]:</i>
            We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the
            Services (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This
            statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your
            web browser.
            </br><br>
            <b>How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?</b>
            </br><br>
            Public Information About Your Activity on the Services:
            Some of your activity on and through the Services is public. This may include, but is not limited to,
            content you have posted publicly on, through or in connection with the Services, including without
            limitation on public portions of Third Party Services, such as your social media accounts.
            Registered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts. Unregistered users will
            not have this association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they
            have visited) may be tracked anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us.
            Please remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the
            Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be
            publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or
            entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We
            therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in
            content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.
            IP Address and Device Information:
            While we collect and store IP address and device information, that information is not made public. We do at
            times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we
            conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.
            Information You Elect to Share:
            You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those
            Third Party Services from within our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or
            practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third
            Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.
            Aggregate and Non-Personally Identifiable Information:
            We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct
            business (“Business Partners”). We may also share information with our Business Partners that is (i) not
            Personal Information or (ii) derived from Personal Information but has been anonymized so that it is no
            longer personally identifiable (collectively with Aggregate Information, “Non-Personal Information”). We
            use and share this type of data so that we and our Business Partners can understand how and how often
            people use our and their services or websites, which facilitates improving our Services, their services and
            how our Services interface with their services. In addition, these Business Partners may share with us
            non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently
            developed or acquired.
            Visiting our websites
            When you visit our other websites, such as www.mooseparkstudios.com, and other websites and forums operated
            by us (“Websites”), we collect information about you, such as details about how you use and interact with
            such Websites. We may use the information we collect about you for a number of purposes, including for
            operating and optimising the Websites, in connection with our advertising purposes, and for research or
            analysis.
            Email and SMS Communications with Us:
            As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive push notifications, email, SMS text and other
            communications from us, such as communications relating to your Account.
            User Profile Information:
            User profile information including your username and other information you enter may be displayed to other
            users to facilitate user interaction within the Services. We will not directly reveal user email addresses
            to other users.
            Social Media Account Login Credentials:
            If you share your Third Party Services account login credentials with us, we may use such information to
            post on your behalf. We will never share or disclose your login credentials outside of our company. We may
            share your User Content (as defined in the Terms of Service), or some derivative thereof, on our
            company-branded social media channels, and we may tag you in such post using your name, social media name,
            handle or other identifier.
            Information Shared with Our Agents:
            We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are
            under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to
            provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to
            use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You
            hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.
            Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:
            In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is
            typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were
            acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that
            is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
            acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
            Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:
            We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe
            is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii)
            enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations
            hereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (iv) respond to
            user support requests or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This
            includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
            spam/malware prevention.
            Information We Share With Your Consent:
            Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third
            parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
            </br><br>
            <b>Is Information About Me Secure?</b>
            </br><br>
            We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the
            security of any Account information. We store all of our information, including your IP address and device
            information, using industry-standard techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will
            prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Information or otherwise.
            Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of
            user information at any time. Additionally, you are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to your
            Account and Personal Information by protecting your Account credentials and limiting access to Service
            Device (as defined in the Terms of Service).
            </br><br>

            </br><br>
            Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so through the App, by deleting the App or by
            emailing support@hy.pe. If you terminate your Account, any association between your Account and information

            </br><br>
            <b>What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?</b>
            </br><br>
            You can use some of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of
            information that we collect.
            You can always opt not to disclose certain information to us, but please note that certain information may
            be needed to take advantage of some of our features.
            You can delete your Account. Please note that we will need to verify that you have the authority to delete
            the Account, and activity generated prior to deletion will remain stored by us and may be publicly
            accessible.
            You can choose to opt out of certain communications or communication methods; however, if you do so, you
            may not be able to take advantage of some of our Services’ best features.
            <br></br>
            <b>What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?</b>
            <br></br>
            We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the

            collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an
            email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such
            changes have been first posted.
            </br><br>
            <b>What If I Have Questions or Concerns?</b>
            </br><br>
